# Plan for Enabling GPU Support in `highspy` Python Package

This document outlines the necessary steps to enable GPU support for the `highspy` Python package by building and distributing a separate GPU-enabled wheel. The chosen strategy is to create a distinct `highspy-gpu` package to avoid dependency conflicts for users who only need CPU support.

## 1. CMake Build System Modifications

The core of the work involves modifying the CMake build configuration to correctly handle CUDA sources and libraries when building the Python extension.

### 1.1. Include CUDA Sources in Python Build

The `cmake/sources-python.cmake` file needs to be updated to conditionally include the CUDA source files when a GPU build is requested.

**File to edit:** `cmake/sources-python.cmake`

**Changes:**
- Add a block that checks for the `CUPDLP_GPU` flag.
- If `CUPDLP_GPU` is ON, append the `cuda_sources_python` to the list of sources for the Python build.

### 1.2. Update Python Extension CMake Configuration

The `cmake/python-highs.cmake` file, which configures the `_core` extension module, needs to be updated to handle CUDA compilation and linking.

**File to edit:** `cmake/python-highs.cmake`

**Changes:**
- Conditionally enable the `CUDA` language when `CUPDLP_GPU` is ON.
- Add necessary include directories for the CUDA toolkit.
- Link against the CUDA libraries (`cudart`, `cublas`, `cusparse`).
- Set `CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION` property for the `_core` target.
- Add a `CUPDLP_GPU` preprocessor definition to ensure GPU-specific code paths are compiled.

### 1.3. Add GPU Detection Logic

A mechanism to find the installed CUDA toolkit needs to be added to the Python build process.

**File to edit:** `cmake/python-highs.cmake`

**Changes:**
- Add logic to use `find_package(CUDAToolkit)` or the existing `FindCUDAConf.cmake` script based on a CMake option. This will locate the necessary CUDA components and libraries.

## 2. Packaging and Distribution (`pyproject.toml`)

To support separate CPU and GPU wheels, we will adjust the packaging configuration to allow for building a `highspy-gpu` wheel.

**File to edit:** `pyproject.toml`

**Changes:**
- Use `scikit-build-core`'s configuration options to dynamically set the package name and pass the required CMake flags for a GPU build.
- The build process for the GPU wheel will be triggered by an environment variable (e.g., `HIGHS_BUILD_GPU=1`).

Example modification in `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[tool.scikit-build]
# ... existing config ...
cmake.define.CUPDLP_GPU = {env = "HIGHS_BUILD_GPU", default = "OFF"}

# Potentially use a different project name for GPU builds
# This might require a separate pyproject.toml or more advanced build scripts.
```
For simplicity, we will start by using an environment variable to control the build type and manually rename the wheel. The long-term solution will involve a more robust mechanism, possibly with a dedicated `pyproject.toml` for the GPU package.

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline Updates

The continuous integration and delivery pipeline will be updated to build and publish both CPU and GPU wheels.

**CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions

**Changes:**
- Create a new workflow for building the GPU wheels, or add a new matrix dimension to the existing build workflow.
- This workflow will run on GPU-enabled runners.
- The workflow will set the `HIGHS_BUILD_GPU=1` environment variable.
- The workflow will install the required CUDA toolkit version.
- The built `highspy-gpu` wheels will be published to PyPI.

## 4. Documentation

The project documentation needs to be updated to inform users about the new GPU package.

**Files to edit:** `README.md`, `docs/`

**Changes:**
- Add a new section in the `README.md` explaining the availability of `highspy-gpu`.
- Provide installation instructions: `pip install highspy-gpu`.
- Document the prerequisites for using the GPU package (NVIDIA drivers, CUDA toolkit version).
- Explain how to verify that the GPU is being used by HiGHS.

## Implementation Steps

1.  **[DONE]** Analyze the existing codebase to understand the current GPU build process for the C++ library.
2.  **[IN PROGRESS]** Implement the CMake changes outlined in Section 1.
   - âœ… **[DONE]** Updated `cmake/sources-python.cmake` to define CUDA sources and headers
   - âœ… **[DONE]** Enhanced `cmake/python-highs.cmake` with comprehensive GPU support including CUDA detection, linking, and compilation flags
   - âœ… **[DONE]** Added conditional inclusion of CUDA sources and headers when `CUPDLP_GPU=ON`
3.  **[PARTIAL]** Modify `pyproject.toml` to allow for a GPU build configuration.
   - âœ… **[DONE]** Added environment variable support for `HIGHS_BUILD_GPU` and `HIGHS_CUDA_FIND`
   - ðŸ”„ **[TODO]** Test the build configuration locally
4.  **[TODO]** Manually build and test the `highspy-gpu` wheel locally.
5.  **[TODO]** Create a new GitHub Actions workflow for building the GPU wheels.
6.  **[TODO]** Update the documentation.
7.  **[TODO]** Publish the first version of `highspy-gpu` to PyPI.

## Current Status

### Recently Completed:
- âœ… Added CUDA source files to the Python build system
- âœ… Implemented comprehensive CUDA toolkit detection (supports both FindCUDAConf and standard CUDAToolkit methods)
- âœ… Added proper CUDA library linking for both Windows and Unix systems
- âœ… Set up CUDA compilation flags and preprocessor definitions
- âœ… Added environment variable controls for GPU builds

### Ready for Testing:
The basic CMake infrastructure is now in place. To test a GPU build, you can now use:
```bash
HIGHS_BUILD_GPU=ON pip install -e .
```

### Next Immediate Steps:
1. Test the build locally with CUDA toolkit installed
2. Verify that GPU code paths are accessible from Python
3. Create test cases to validate GPU functionality
